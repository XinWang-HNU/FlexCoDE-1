\title{Spectral Series Regression}
\usage{
regressionFunction.Series(x, responses, extra = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{matrix with covariates that will be used for training}

\item{responses}{matrix where each column is a response for the training data}

\item{extra}{list with two components: the first is named epsGrid, which contains a vetor with different number of bandwidths to be used in the gaussian kernel; the function will choose the best value among them; the second is called nXMax and contains a single integer number that describes what is the maximum number of spectral basis functions with be used}
}
\value{
object of the class Series containing information needed to perform prediction on new points
}
\description{
This function is typically not directly used by the user; it is used inside  \code{\link{fitFlexCoDE}}
